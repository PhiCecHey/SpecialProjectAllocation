Lamadrid,4 : IKI - KTw: Advanced Structures,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,30,240,90,"The Equivalent Frame Method (EFM) is a simplified modeling technique widely used for seismic analysis of unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings. It was developed to address the limitations of more computationally demanding methods like finite element methods (FEM) and discrete element methods (DEM), particularly when analyzing entire masonry buildings. Masonry walls are modelled as beam elements with nonlinear behaviour which reduces the computational efforts, however this approach in addition to other simplification imply the overlooking of critical aspects/areas. As it focuses on analyzing the global structural behaviour, detailed insights into local failures or interactions between different structural coponents are not addressed.    For the past 30 years, the ongoing research about the EFM limitations and advantages has grown rapidly, focusing on solving open issues (e.g., interaction of in-plane and out-plane mechanisms, influence of flexible diaphragms, precense of irregular layouts of openings). A relevant example is the case of the “flange effect”, which refer to the structural behavior observed in walls with flanged geometries (e.g., T-shaped or L-shaped configurations) where the interaction between different wall components (flange and web) significantly influences the overall strength and stiffness. Traditional EFM struggles to fully campture this interaction as the load transfer is simplified, even with the variation of boundary conditions.    To address this challenge, the project has as objective the elaboration of the current EFM state of the art with a focus on the latest advances and experimental studies addressing the unresolved challenges of the EFM. Particularly, the projects aims to identify the studies (either experimental or analytical) addressing the flange effect and its incorporation in the EFM.  Tasks:  - State of the art:   1. The Equivalent frame Method  2. URM flanged walls, including but not limited to the definition of URM flanged walls in international standards (guidelines or codes), their classification (based in geometry), variations on boundary conditions, damage progression in flanged walls observed in experimental campaigns  - Benchmark cases: Collection of cases where experimental/analytical studies have addressed the response of flanged walls, material properties as well as results are provided and the case can be analiticaly replicated.  - Analytical model: SAP2000 model of a flanged wall (L, T or U shapes) using as reference one of the found benchmark cases.

Within that system, the infill wall is considered to be a non-structural component, while the frame is considered to be structural. When these structures are excited by seismic actions, the infill interacts with the surrounding frame and affects the overall stiffness, strength and ductility of the structure.  It is well known that seismic actions result in inter-storey drift and inertial forces. Inter-storey drift is the consequence of rigid diaphragm movement during earthquake shaking. In addition, inertial forces, acting on the frames and the masonry infill members, are opposite in direction to the accelerating force induced by the earthquake, and are equal to the product of the accelerating force and the mass of the structural members. The inertial forces are also dominant in the upper area of the structure, while the inter-storey drift forces are dominant in the lower storeys. To reflect such phenomena in an experimental set-up, the inter-storey drift forces could be represented by concentrated loads, applied directly onto the frame, while the inertial forces could be represented by infill wall pressurizing systems, such as airbags.  Understanding the damage causing effects and loads (respective displacements/ drifts) is essential for the derivation of mitigation measures. The project aims to investigate the drift distribution in multi-story RC frame structures with URM infill walls as well as determination of design loads for the infill walls in out-of-plane direction in dependence of the location.    Tasks:  - Literature Review: Conduct a comprehensive review: of experimental test on RC frame buildings with infill walls relevant to this study; studies towards drift distribution in multi-story RC buildings; design ruls for URM infill walls in out-of-plane direction; mitigation measures to prevent out-of-plane failure;  - Analytical Modeling: Develop analytical models of RC frames with unreinforced masonry infill walls with varying material properties and geometric configurations to derive drift pattern and seismic loading conditions for the design of the URM infill walls in OoP direction.  - Comparitive study and Evaluation: Compare the results with the criteria outlined in seismic design standards e.g. EC 8, highlighting the turning point with respect to damage causing effects/ loads in dependence of infill wall material and geometrie.  - Documentation: Document the methodology, analysis, and findings in a detailed project report, including a discussion of implications for seismic design practices and recommendations for future research.",,"5 : Variant V: Project (12 ECTS), one student",0,0,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1 : 1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Due to the brittle nature of shear failures, design codes impose limitations on the nominal shear strength of these structural elements. Yet, neglecting the shear failure modes in existing buildings, or in buildings with significant irregularities, can result in an overestimation of their overall capacity.  Estimating the shear resistance of RC elements is grounded in well-established models of shear mechanisms, such as the strut and tie model. However, explicitly modeling the nonlinear behavior remains a challenge when dealing with RC frames. Specifically, hysteretic models simulate shear strength degradation and the inelastic axial-shear-flexure interactions. Some researchers turn to post-processing techniques as an alternative. Moreover, the modeling of elements that interact with the frame is crucial when estimating the shear demand in frame elements. For instance, contact between infills and columns is often overlooked when using strut models for infills.  This project aims to introduce the student to the fundamentals of nonlinear shear behavior modeling in RC columns and its influence on nonlinear flexure behavior and strength deterioration parameters.    Tasks:  - Literature review on concentrated plasticity modelling of reinforced concrete columns capturing shear-flexure interaction.   - Literature review on the considerations of nonlinear shear behaviour and its influence on nonlinear flexure behaviour.   - Numerical simulation of the monotonic and cyclic behavior of RC columns using a variety of models with differing nonlinear shear modeling considerations.

This is primarily because traditional masonry lacks sufficient ductility and energy dissipation capacity to withstand significant seismic forces. However, the overstrength factor, which represents the extra strength beyond the designed capacity of a structure, plays a critical role in the seismic performance of masonry buildings. The overstrength can provide additional safety margins, enabling these buildings to resist greater forces than anticipated by design.  Understanding how different material properties and geometric characteristics of masonry structures influence the overstrength factor is essential for improving seismic design standards, particularly in moderate seismicity zones. This project aims to investigate the sensitivity of overstrength parameters to various masonry materials and structural geometries within the context of German seismic design standards. By focusing on factors such as wall thickness, height-to-length ratios, and material strength, the study will provide valuable insights into optimizing masonry design to enhance safety and resilience during seismic events.   The study will utilize methodologies from FEMA P695 and NRC 2021 to analyze how these factors influence the overstrength and overall seismic behavior of masonry structures. By exploring these parameters, the project will provide insights into optimizing masonry design for enhanced safety and resilience in earthquake-prone areas    Tasks:  - Literature Review: Conduct a comprehensive review of the seismic performance of masonry structures, focusing on the overstrength factor and its relevance in German seismic design standards.

During these events, damage induced to the structure may lead to collapse resulting in economic and/or human losses.  In attempt to understand the structure under critical conditions, we perform a laboratory experiment with a reinforced concrete beam. The numerical simulation is carried out to predict the beam under the crack/damage conditions. It is worth noting that, the reinforced concrete behaves different from general homogenized materials as the discontinuity occurs only in concrete, whilst the steel bar works continuously. To address this issue, the conventional XFEM has been modified, in which we consider enrichment functions for both concrete and steel bar elements. This method allows significantly reducing the computational costs. We want to evaluate the model by the comparison of the XFEM with general FE such as Code_Bright, which uses a smeared crack approach.

In order to minimise the impact, modern renovation and retrofitting measures are used for existing buildings to extend their useful life. However, appropriate precautions must also be taken for new buildings. New materials that consume fewer resources in production, release fewer climate-damaging substances or achieve higher strengths make an important contribution here. Regardless of this, an efficient use of materials can be achieved by specifically influencing the flow of forces in the supporting structure. An excellent example of this are form-optimised load-bearing structures, which transfer the load mainly via normal forces rather than via bending and shear.    Since the optimal shape is only determined for one loading situation, usually for dead weight, the theoretical optimal shape deviates from the determined geometry for all other occurring loading situations, which leads to less efficient material utilisation. However, if several load scenarios are taken into account at the same time, a shape can be found that does not represent the optimum shape for any of the load scenarios examined, but which guarantees the most efficient material utilisation overall.    The aim of this special project is therefore to investigate methods of optimising the shape of load-bearing structures under consideration of different loading situations.    Tasks:  • Literature review on optimisation-based design of structures with focus on concrete structures.  • Developing and implementing a framework for an optimisation-based design of 2D and 3D structures in MATLAB. Code for form finding for one load case will be provided.  • Validation of the implemented method.  ",,"5 : Variant V: Project (12 ECTS), one student",0,0,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1 : 1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

However, the interplay between the deck geometry and the aeroelastic response is particularly complicated because the spacing between the girders is an additional variable that affects the interaction between the upstream deck and the downstream deck in its wake. This complexity makes it difficult to predict the aerodynamic behavior of twin-deck girder bridges when changes are made to the deck geometry.

In general, screw fittings are used, which consist of a steel construction screw, a nut and, if necessary, washers. The load-bearing capacity of such connections has already been investigated in detail in various research projects, always under the premise that the maximum tensile load-bearing capacity of the bolt can be transferred and consequently a failure occurs in the bolt. The influences of the nut are largely neglected and remain unconsidered.   When connecting steel components, nuts may not be used, either for aesthetic reasons or because the connection point cannot be reached during assembly (see box sections). So-called “thread-fixed one side bolts” (TFOSB) are often used here, whereby the nut is omitted and a threaded hole is used. With such connections, the tensile load-bearing capacity can no longer be assessed by the screw alone, but rather depends on the threaded hole in the ""base material"". The available depth of the hole, i.e. the screwing depth, is of fundamental importance here. For this reason, the tensile load-bearing capacity of connections with different screwing depths is to be measured, analyzed and evaluated in experimental tests.

Lightweight and slender structures, due to their low structural damping, are prone to excessive displacements and accelerations under external loads. These large structural responses can lead to serviceability issues and potential damage. Addressing this, our focus is on increasing the damping of such structures to limit displacements and ensure serviceability.    The primary goal of this project is to enhance the damping characteristics of low-damped structures. By integrating supplemental damping systems, we aim to mitigate the effects of external loads, thereby reducing structural displacements and improving overall performance.    The following tasks are expected within the project:  Dynamic Modeling: Develop a detailed dynamic model of tall structures using a Multi-Degree-of-Freedom (MDOF) system approach. This will involve the application of Finite Element Method (FEM) techniques to accurately capture the dynamic behavior of the structure.    Supplemental Damping Calculation: Determine the optimal parameters for supplemental damping systems. This involves calculating the required damping to effectively reduce displacements and improve the structure's response under various loading conditions.    Verification: Assess the coupled response of the structure with the added damping effects. This will include simulating the structural response with and without the supplemental damper, using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations , to verify the effectiveness of the damping solution.

This is achieved by the introduction of horizontally flexible elements (isolators) between the superstructure and the foundation. By separating the structure from its base (decoupling) the amount of energy that is transferred to the superstructure during an earthquake is reduced significantly.     Modern isolation systems, comprising by friction pendulums or rubber bearings, can be costly, making them inaccessible for many applications, especially in developing countries. With this in mind, we review common low-cost isolation systems, i.e., scrap tire isolators, with emphasis to sustainable solutions, with low cost and simple installation. Priority is given in understanding the axial and shear response mechanisms of such isolations under strong ground motion. A finite element model of the low cost isolator in question is developed using advanced computational software (SAP2000, ABAQUS,etc.). Contact shall be made with manufacturers in Germany and Ecuador for the possibility of production of a low-cost isolator, and its testing by the end of the academic year.  ","Farzad N and Kelly J.
